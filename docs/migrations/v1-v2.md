#### Migration from 1.X to 2.X

### Differences
### 1.0.0
  - Only exports one package (`react-data-grid`);
  - To use the addons the import would be `react-data-grid/addons`, that would just point to `react-data-grid.ui-plugins.js` on the dist folder for the package;
  - To get the styling you would either need to copy grid's css or reference the css file on the dist folder

### 2.0.0
  - Exports two main packages (`react-data-grid` and `react-data-grid-addons`);
  - Both packages have independent releases; 
  - You get all the default css styling for free, if you want a custom styled grid you will only need to override the intended classnames.
  
### Steps for a sucessfull migration
  - Install react-data-grid-addons package (```npm install react-data-grid-addons```)
  - Imports for `react-data-grid/addons` you will need to replaced by `react-data-grid-addons`
  - If you have a copy of the default grid styling you can drop it off, if you have some custom classnames you just need to override those specific classnames
